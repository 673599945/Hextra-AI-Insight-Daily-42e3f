### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as needed for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to meet our legal obligations (like if we need to hold your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obligated to keep this data for longer periods.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might be moved to — and kept on — computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the data protection laws might differ from those in your jurisdiction.

By consenting to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving the green light to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data, or ask us to help you delete it, that we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about you right from within the Service itself.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, modify, or delete it. You can also get in touch with us to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

But heads up: we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might be asked to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your child has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires consent from a parent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before changes become effective, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We advise you to give this Privacy Policy a regular once-over for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are good to go when they're posted on this page.
