## 1. About Our Services
The Site, **ai.hubtoday**, offers users paid subscription content and member services. This cool stuff includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up: some content is only for our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Account
*   **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no** transferring or sharing your account.
*   **We** have the right to **suspend or terminate** any account if a user violates these Terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Our subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis. Don't worry, the fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** go through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we never store your payment info.
*   **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy:** First-time subscribers, if you're not stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these Terms and let us know why you're not happy. Each user gets one refund chance, so use it wisely!
